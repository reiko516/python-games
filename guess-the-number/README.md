guess-the-number
================

The second project for "An Interactive Introduction to Python" through Rice University on Coursera.

Our objective here was to create a "Guess the number" game where the computer plays the part of the second player, and the user tries to guess. Since the game makes use of Code Skulptor's GUI library and won't run without it, you can [play the game here] (http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user10_1gTz58IzQpJzc6K.py).
