rpsls

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This was my first Python project for "An Interactive Introduction to Python" through Rice University on Coursera. 

The initial instructions just had us testing the rpsls() function by calling it several times at once with each possible choice, but I added in two lines at the end to make it function more like an actual text game that someone could run and play. I'd like to refine it even more by creating a GUI at some point.The initial instructions just had us testing the rpsls() function by calling it several times at once with each possible choice, but I added in two lines at the end to make it function more like an actual text game that someone could run and play.
