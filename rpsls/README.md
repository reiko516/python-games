Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
=====

This was my first Python project for "An Interactive Introduction to Python" through Rice University on Coursera. 

A play on the traditional "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, this iteration had us developing the logic necessary to add two extra choices, and then figure out which choice would win in which situations.

The initial instructions just had us testing the game's function by calling it several times at once with each possible choice and printing it to the console, but I added in two lines at the end to make it function more like an actual text game that someone could just run themselves and play.
