python-games
============

Collection of games I coded for  “[An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python] (https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython).”

Everything was created in [CodeSkulptor] (http://www.codeskulptor.org/), a browser-based Python interpreter developed by the instructors. Since they also created a custom GUI library specifically for rendering graphics in the browser, I don't think these programs (except for the text based ones) can run anywhere except in CodeSkulptor (at least not that I know of). 

To aid in exploring these programs, each game folder includes the following:

 - Description of the project in README file
 - File of the final code
 - URL to CodeSkulptor to view the game in action
 - Screenshots of the game where applicable
