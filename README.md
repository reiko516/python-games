python-games
============

Collection of games I coded for  “<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython" target="_blank">An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python</a>.”

Everything was created in <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/" target="_blank">CodeSkulptor</a>, a browser-based Python interpreter developed by the instructors. Since they also created a custom GUI library specifically for rending graphics in the browser, I don't think these programs can run anywhere except in CodeSkulptor (at least not that I know of). 

To aid in exploring these programs, each game folder includes the following:
<ul>
	<li>Description of the project in README file</li>
	<li>File of the final code</li>
	<li>URL to CodeSkulptor to view the game in action</li>
	<li>Screenshots of the game (in case URL doesn't work for some reason)</li>
</ul>
